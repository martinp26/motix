This is a free vector font family designed for small display sizes (or
a lot of characters on large displays)

What is contained
=================

The monospace variant comes in four flavors:
* normal
* italic
* bold
* bold-italic

There is also a small proportial version for saving even more
horizontal space (e.g., for the emacs mode line or play lists in
audacious).

Characters
==========

The monospace version cover:
* ASCII
* Latin1
* Greek
* Mathematical symbols
* Different arrows
* Block graphics
* Various useful symbols

Design
======

The font family was originally designed for a pixel grid of size 5x10.
It has since been traced to a vector representation which allows easy
scaling to larger sizes.  Also antialiasing and sub-pixel can
dramatically improve the display quality.

The font family was also designed with readability in mind, especially
for distinguishing "o", "O", and "0" etc. which is important for
programming.

Usage
=====

Copy the generated TTF files to a directory searched by your font
engines (e.g., ~/.fonts).

Start, for example, an xterm like this:

  xterm -fa motix_round:pixelsize=10
